# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository named "toushi" containing:
- A basic README.md with just the project name
- An empty HTML file (toushi.html)

## Architecture

This appears to be a very early-stage project with minimal structure. The repository contains only placeholder files and no build system, dependencies, or code architecture has been established yet.

## Development

No build tools, package managers, or development scripts have been configured. This is a blank slate project that will require setting up the development environment and architecture as needed.
